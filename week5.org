+ proverbs 28 the wicked flea though no one pursues but the righteous are as bold as a lion

+ you have to really want to solve the problem
  + you have to really wish to search
  
+ is it problem searching or problem solving
  
+ when you're really stuck try some other task

+ keep a list of problems to work on
+ as questions arise when you're studying keep a list

+ some problems are too hard to work on with your current background


+ read the book and try to visualize in your mind what the book said

+ repetition will develop skill
  + repeat problem searching and also proving the theorems material learned
  + repetition in reading comprehension
  + repetition and problem searching
  
  
+ as you're solving the problem visualize in your mind where you are in the search
  + keep track of the alternate pads that you can take
  + be mindful of where you are at the moment
+ build a scaffold to learn a new material quickly
  + understand where you are in the scaffold
  + visualize in your mind where it could be
  



+ don't create an unnecessary measure

+ time management
  + don't search for things that are not there. you may end up wasting time. before you look make sure that it's reasonable
  
+ don't be afraid of the question do I suck at math?
  + this question occurs a lot when I'm solving a problem and I got stuck
  + or when I am afraid of a problem
  
+ don't assume a particular path to a solution
+ do not prove what is not possible to prove
  + always check for feasibility
  + always make sure you understand the problem and the definitions correctly
  + it is possible that there's a typo or that you misunderstand and what you're trying to prove is not possible
  
+ you need practice both. proving statement truth and the false 

+ if you're stuck try to prove the negation
+ if you're stuck look for counter examples to what you're trying to prove
+ if you're stuck check if you are proving something that is not possible to prove
    

+ how to better use time without feeling anxious?
  + how can I use 1 hour 30 minutes effectively?

+ how to search and navigate the problem without getting lost?
  + try to get the big picture of what you're doing
  + use your intuition to guide yourself to the solution
    + sketch out the big idea fill in the details later
  + management techniques trees
  + what can we control, see the parameters of each object you're working with
  + when you're done with the problem look at the path to the solution. see if it is good or if it can be improved
    + see how you can discover the path to the solution
  + don't do stuff randomly hoping to get across a good idea
    + have purpose to each step and time spent. be deliberate
  + is there a important object or property that you can find or need to be true?
    + which can be used to direct the search
    + is there an example that makes the conclusion true
    + what is the property of this example?
  + contrapositive is a great way to look at a problem differently
  + keep the conclusion and your goal in mind
+ look for counter examples if you wish to prove something false
+ after proving a theorem check the converse
  + see if some conditions can be dropped
  + see if a condition is dropped why it is false
  + see the key techniques used in the theorem
  + see the key relationships using the theorem
  
    
  

+ pay attention to your voice. I often talk to myself when I'm going through the problem.

    
+ close eyes nap to relearn all the stuff at 20x speed
  + can you do this while studying? on the fly?
  + meditate
  + when anxious also do this
  
+ study each topic 2hr each day
  + get up at 6
  + change topic if stuck
  + study over many days
  
+ work hard in a natural, smart, logical way
+ build a scaffold when learning
  
+ try to improve your visual memory

+ numerical exam
  + how can i prepare better for exams in the future?

+ ask questions that are meaningful and relvant
  + questions when answered will solve your problem for sure
  + similar to thinking in a direction that will guarantee or is likely to give you the solution
  + apply this in your daily life
+ keep in mind the original purpose of what we are doing

+ loosening up relaxing during exam
  + believing that you have already passed
  + do not do this! it is not true
