When an important exercise you are doing isnt going well, forego the other lifts, focus in getting that fixed 
Focus on this only. what will.help you get better? proper technique, form and intensity 
importance of brisk walking, running around cardio

internal rotate shoulder pulled back down

novelty stimulus
blood flow cardio

* how to lift it
** Form
+ go slow
+ are you spending enough time under tension?
** Compound movements
+ are going to get you strong
** minor muscle stability
+ upper arm stability bicep tricep

* forearm pain
+ sypport/absorb shock eoth lats?
* lift
+ Treat lifting like a combat
+ give it your all squeeze ouy every last
  + internal rotation of.shoulders
  + place it behind chair for support
* General Tips
+ 6 sets of 10, 2 min rest, lower weight if cant complete 10
+ build up lactic acid
+ every set rep should.be precious, challeneging, meaningful
+ step 888 -> 889 later sets more reps
+ 3 week rep 3 week weight 1 week deload
+ increase time under tension
+ need to train rotator cuffs
+ right shoulder down and back
  + elbow pain
+ dont fold the forearm for vertical support
 + use tricep to balance out and support  


 
 
* running
+ breathing
* How to make the knee area more stable?
    - awesome bliss Copenhagen plank
    - Laydown and raise legs and see what muscles are keeping knee stable
    - Why is knee stable in deadlift? (because the knees are straight)
    - Right now my guess is that there are some stabizing muscles that are weak or that you are not aware of
    - Why is the knee not stable?
    - Why is it fine when you drop down?
    - I guess that my knees are not in the proper position to press up. I'm loosing slack somewher

* PULL
** Deadlift
+ slight right arm unstable why?
  + internal rotate shoulder? shoulder stabil,
+ knee wide and in stable using muscles
+ 5 step deadlift (lock hips, brace, tight push)
  + bar 1 inch from shin
  + lock hips in position, by bending knees
  + chest down, brace
  + glutes ham tight, knees outward then push
    + glutes hamstring tight
+ drop bar down slow for form
+ drag bar up knees for weight near hinge   
+ work more on lower back stability, push with hips to finish
  + legs gotta be angled to drive hips forward
  + save hip drive for the end, practice paused lifts, downwards and upwards

+ shins straight
+ bar over mid foot
+ rotate around bar so rear delts over bar
+ hip and ham tight
+ push with legs
+ it is harder tonlift from lower point. how can i over come this? reinspect starting point of lift
+ Hamstring hips tight lats tight
+ stomach between thighs before brace
+ use psoas (ham muscles) to stabilize
+ foot weight distribution
    - right shoulder joint loose keep it tight
    - bend bar

    - Pause deadlift at 3 points, as soon as bar lifts, below knee, above knee
      + initial lift off ground with hamstring hips
      + lats and triceps, arms tight
    - lift lower half with leg press
        - upper with hip hinge drive
        - do not pull initial with back
    - **Neck down!!! DURING THE ENTIRE LIFT,** breathe lock
    - Arms go down to tighten back
    - Feel the hips after making sure back is straight
    - Practice Good Mornings/ barbell row
    - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoWsyPiYqAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoWsyPiYqAw)
        - Straighten back hip drive
        - bracing
        - Make sure back is straight/neck down during entire lift or else you are lifting with back
    - Hips and chest aligned
        - alignted while standing
        - alligned at bottom of lift
    - Hips and chest rise at same time
    - create wedge, slightly rotate hips outwards
    - Need hips to be going down/ mechanically working to align
** Row
+ initial tension with quads ham for support
+ taught leg press slightly below knee
+ row
+ right shoulder unstable?
  + inward rotation?
  
** Pullups
+ press up as going down
+ right arm forearm pain, shoulder unstable?
  + happens with heavier weights
+ rotate arm inward! elbow inward
+ lock biceps and pull
  + tight bicep triceps stability

+ keep shoulder locked whole time

+ notice wheb you contraxt without bar how you can squeeze chest better

  + no weight should be on your arms
+ external rotation feel the muscle
- Hip drive

+ slow first
+ hip add abductions? role in squating
+ foot distrivution
