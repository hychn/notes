* How to make the knee area more stable?
    - awesome bliss Copenhagen plank
    - Laydown and raise legs and see what muscles are keeping knee stable
    - Why is knee stable in deadlift? (because the knees are straight)
    - Right now my guess is that there are some stabizing muscles that are weak or that you are not aware of
    - Why is the knee not stable?
    - Why is it fine when you drop down?
    - I guess that my knees are not in the proper position to press up. I'm loosing slack somewher
