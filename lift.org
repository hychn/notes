* How to make the knee area more stable?
    - awesome bliss Copenhagen plank
    - Laydown and raise legs and see what muscles are keeping knee stable
    - Why is knee stable in deadlift? (because the knees are straight)
    - Right now my guess is that there are some stabizing muscles that are weak or that you are not aware of
    - Why is the knee not stable?
    - Why is it fine when you drop down?
    - I guess that my knees are not in the proper position to press up. I'm loosing slack somewher
* Squat
+ i dont feel the power out of the hole
  + keep tensions tight
- Hip drive
  + dont fall back too much, maybe thats why the weight isnin your toes
- Squeeze hams
  + when weight is on heel hamstrings need to squeeze more?
+ slow first
+ hip add abductions? role in squating
+ foot distrivution
+ initial unrack tight
+ keep chest down and algin spine and hip
+ lats tight, elbows forward
- drive the hips inside, train this level by level as you go down
+ go down slow
  + i keep running outnof breadth
- 2 exercise, side plank and ankle stretch
- dont look at mirror keep neck spine align
- leg press at bottom (like deadlift)
- [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RGb4Di4Dk_k][vid]]

- laydown and raise legs in squat position to find good squad width
- pull the bar down on yourself
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbUqxi4Yjfo][vid]]
- Spread legs out as you lift up to use hip at the end?
- Put weight on heels so you can drive with hip starting from bottom
- Lat pulldown?
- Chest down and put alot of strength on stomach. lock the stomach?
- As your hips move back, move your knees forward b//c hips should be close to centerline
* Deadlift
+ Hamstring hips tight lats tight

        - alligned at bottom of lift
    - Hips and chest rise at same time
    - create wedge, slightly rotate hips outwards
    - Need hips to be going down/ mechanically working to align
* Bench press
+ notice wheb you contraxt without bar how you can squeeze chest better
  + can youbdo something similar with bar
  + the bicep rotates toward chest
+ go down slow, load & stretch the chest muscles and contract
+ maybe need to refigure how to contract chest
  + internally rotate shoulder?
  + get a better squeeze
+ pain while bending elbow, get better at bending at the elbow
  + curls
+ use lats to.push weight off from.chest?
