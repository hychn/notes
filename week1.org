* Routine
  + Reading Ahead
    + 
  + Understanding
    + 
    + Asking questions, collecting small properties
 
* Reflections
+ Some people do proofs to relax, to get excited
  + If you master it, it becomes trivial and not exciting
  
+ Not getting lost. Confidence going down a path of thinking.
  + make your thoughts and conclusions precise. 
  + Know what you do not know!
  + Have no assumptions! difference in what you think is promising, and what is true
  + As long as you have clear starting point, idea, motivation; you will not be lost
  + precise, sharp, no fear. If confused, return to starting point
  
  
+ Mathematics is an accumilation, not replacement
  + Strong foundation, broader
  + Your efforts will be rewarded

+ Put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind

+ How can I remember small properties and traits of certain definitions?
  + Where should I commit them in memory? probably following the definition
  
  
 + Teaching yourself

+ How to get a clear view of the situation
  + brain works better at manipulating things looking at a clear view
  + put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind
 
+ What is the minimal requirement?

+ Come to a conclusion after an encounter and a thinking session
+ Impress the significance of discoveries to remember
+ Know it so well, almost like a fact

+ Consider all of this as your training
  + What if I drop 1 condition, what can I conclude
  + How come this theorem stays, what is it's significance? Look at the big picture.
  + Can I get guess the result, find it?
  
  
+ Work smart, from different angles
+ Ask yourself, do I understand this concept
  
+ Good intuition, basic understanding, a correct idea, a rigourous proof

+ Maybe you need 1 small hint


+ Developed to understand real life phenomina
+ Stick with 1 book in the beginning. It will prevent unneccesary confusion

+ Some things I remember, somethings I cannot. What is the difference?
  + The significance is not impressed on you
  + ex: remember things said during lecture
  + ex: dont remember continuous hypothesis conditions of theorem
  + ex: dont remember properties of sequences and functions

+ Stuck: confusing notation, misreading/misunderstanding
  + How can I not get stuck in the future
  + Read carefully if you do not understand
  + Try to see what it is saying
  + Remember the statement exactly and your memory and try to see what it is trying to do.
  
+ How to get a clear view of the situation
  + brain works better at manipulating things looking at a clear view
  + put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind
  
+ Conserve your effort with writing
+ Draw a picture
