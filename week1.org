* Asking Questions
* Solving Questions




* Reflections ==========================================================

* trust in the Lord
+ Peace be with you
+ Face your trauma with problem solving
+ Relax, breathe
+ Worry about what you can improve 

* Problem solving
+ Does it make sense, is it reasonable?
+ Think in more powerful, general ways
+ Art of setting of the problem so that the answer can be obtained easily?
 

* Make the most of each encounter with an idea
+ You cannot learn everything but when given an opportunity to look at an idea
+ devote all you can and perhaps return to it later
+ when you can & organize your findings

* Practice in going in every direction: Problem <-> Motivation <-> work
+ This will help you increase in speed

* Train of thought navigation
+ quickly test your idea? before spending too much time on it?
  + Assume the thing you are trying to prove is true and follow the chain of conclusions
  + Find a counter example
  + Will the idea guarantee a solution reasonably?
+ Try to find a reasonable method assuming the theorem or thing you are trying to find exists

* How to sit for long times
+ Support spine with core and glutes and hamstring
+ Dont support it all with neck... you'll get neck pain
+ Go on walks hill/flat descent to get blood flow
  
* Need to develop isolating my mind to think very clearly about a specific setting
+ Without assumptions
+ Blacking out your mind, forgetting

* Always ask yourself, how can I become effective, efficient at what I am doing?

* How to get a clear view of the situation
+ brain works better at manipulating things looking at a clear view
+ put the situation in your memory and see them manipulate form in your mind

* Treat each statement as alive, transforming at the adjustable parts
* Refine, Mininmize the essence of each idea you encounter

* Dealing with frustration

* Note the key relationships you discover
+ Treat them as signficant discoveries
+ Familiarize yourself with their significance
* A particular view, a vista, a perspective: recognize abstractly what perspective it is?

* Some people do proofs to relax, to get excited
+ If you master it, it becomes trivial and not exciting
+ My brain is wired to like easy problems
  + Rewire myself to appreciate a good challenge, a puzzle
  + Draw to more difficult things

* Not getting lost. Confidence going down a path of thinking.
+ make your thoughts and conclusions precise. 
+ Know what you do not know!
+ Have no assumptions! difference in what you think is promising, and what is true
+ As long as you have clear starting point, idea, motivation; you will not be lost
+ precise, sharp, no fear. If confused, return to starting point

* Stuck: confusing notation, misreading/misunderstanding
+ How can I not get stuck in the future
+ Read carefully if you do not understand
+ Try to see what it is saying
+ Remember the statement exactly and your memory and try to see what it is trying to do.
+ If it is not making alot of sense, probably you are understanding it wrong
+ Sometimes you need to get the general idea by yourself, it may not be written or communicated.
  + Find out what the equation or the theorem is saying in a broad, general sense



* How can I think more on the fly?

* Write the sub problems clearly
+ starting point, idea, motivation 

* Mathematics is an accumilation, not replacement
+ Strong foundation, broader
+ Your efforts will be rewarded

* Put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind

* How can I remember small properties and traits of certain definitions?
+ Where should I commit them in memory? probably following the definition
  
  
* Look for questions, objectives, patterns that repeat
 
* What is the minimal requirement?

* Come to a conclusion after an encounter and a thinking session

* Impress the significance of discoveries to remember
* Be confident in the tangible consequences, conclusions of your work

* Know it so well, almost like a fact

* Consider all of this as your training
+ What if I drop 1 condition, what can I conclude
+ How come this theorem stays, what is it's significance? Look at the big picture.
+ Can I get guess the result, find it?
  
  
* Work smart, from different angles
* Ask yourself, do I understand this concept
  
* Good intuition, basic understanding, a correct idea, a rigourous proof

* Maybe you need 1 small hint


* Developed to understand real life phenomina
* Stick with 1 book in the beginning. It will prevent unneccesary confusion

* Some things I remember, somethings I cannot. What is the difference?
+ The significance is not impressed on you
+ ex: remember things said during lecture
+ ex: dont remember continuous hypothesis conditions of theorem
+ ex: dont remember properties of sequences and functions

  
* How to get a clear view of the situation
+ brain works better at manipulating things looking at a clear view
+ put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind
  
* Conserve your effort with writing
* Draw a picture
