* Routine
+ Read Ahead: Scouting ahead
  + Build outline
+ UnderstandLecture
  + Read
  + Ask questions
  + Solve questions
  + Collect useful properties
  + Create teaching notes
+ Qual Prep
  + Solve problems
  
* Asking Questions
* Solving Questions


+ Does it make snese, is it reasonable?
+ Think in more powerful, general ways
+ Art of setting of the problem so that the answer can be obtained easily?
 
* Reflections


+ Train of thought navigation
  + quickly test your idea? before spending too much time on it?
    + Assume the thing you are trying to prove is true and follow the chain of conclusions
    + Find a counter example
    + Will the idea guarantee a solution reasonably?
  
+ How to get a clear view of the situation
  + brain works better at manipulating things looking at a clear view
  + put the situation in your memory and see them manipulate form in your mind

+ Treat each statement as alive, transforming at the adjustable parts
+ Refine, Mininmize the essence of each idea you encounter

+ Dealing with frustration

+ Note the key relationships you discover
  + Treat them as signficant discoveries
  + Familiarize yourself with their significance
+ A particular view, a vista, a perspective: recognize abstractly what perspective it is?

+ Some people do proofs to relax, to get excited
  + If you master it, it becomes trivial and not exciting
  + My brain is wired to like easy problems
    + Rewire myself to appreciate a good challenge, a puzzle
    + Draw to more difficult things
  
+ Not getting lost. Confidence going down a path of thinking.
  + make your thoughts and conclusions precise. 
  + Know what you do not know!
  + Have no assumptions! difference in what you think is promising, and what is true
  + As long as you have clear starting point, idea, motivation; you will not be lost
  + precise, sharp, no fear. If confused, return to starting point
  
+ Write the sub problems clearly
  + starting point, idea, motivation 

+ Mathematics is an accumilation, not replacement
  + Strong foundation, broader
  + Your efforts will be rewarded

+ Put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind

+ How can I remember small properties and traits of certain definitions?
  + Where should I commit them in memory? probably following the definition
  
  
+ Look for questions, objectives, patterns that repeat
 
+ What is the minimal requirement?

+ Come to a conclusion after an encounter and a thinking session

+ Impress the significance of discoveries to remember
+ Be confident in the tangible consequences, conclusions of your work

+ Know it so well, almost like a fact

+ Consider all of this as your training
  + What if I drop 1 condition, what can I conclude
  + How come this theorem stays, what is it's significance? Look at the big picture.
  + Can I get guess the result, find it?
  
  
+ Work smart, from different angles
+ Ask yourself, do I understand this concept
  
+ Good intuition, basic understanding, a correct idea, a rigourous proof

+ Maybe you need 1 small hint


+ Developed to understand real life phenomina
+ Stick with 1 book in the beginning. It will prevent unneccesary confusion

+ Some things I remember, somethings I cannot. What is the difference?
  + The significance is not impressed on you
  + ex: remember things said during lecture
  + ex: dont remember continuous hypothesis conditions of theorem
  + ex: dont remember properties of sequences and functions

+ Stuck: confusing notation, misreading/misunderstanding
  + How can I not get stuck in the future
  + Read carefully if you do not understand
  + Try to see what it is saying
  + Remember the statement exactly and your memory and try to see what it is trying to do.
  
+ How to get a clear view of the situation
  + brain works better at manipulating things looking at a clear view
  + put the situation in your mind and see them manipulate form in your mind
  
+ Conserve your effort with writing
+ Draw a picture
