- old theorem. can you rediscover path to conclusion?
- what are my strengths?
  - asking questions, 
  

* Mentality
- Your joy comes from Christ. Nothing else on earth can provide it.
- If it is true, there must be a solution
- Once you have an heuristic that works, it is relaxing, like sewing - Russian Undergrad
- Revisit and improve your solutions, understanding, and methods.
- Hyper, deep, relaxed focus

* Heuristic
- Narrow the search space w/ a strong observation
  - Where could the problem be? It must be here, o.w. everything is trivial

- Simple low depth first
- Work with conclusion & hypothesis
- Go to definitions
- Examples that work and don't work.
- Draw a picture
- Sketch out your idea, see where the problems could be

- Consider equivalent forms of conclusions and hypothesis
- Consider other implications to conclusion

- What the question is asking
- A feeling/reasons that you are going in a right direction
  - Otherwise you will get lost and lose alot of time.
- Ask what you need.
- What do you need to find? Can you define, guess it?

- Be very careful at each step. Dont rule out something true.

* Stuck/Messy/Lost
- When you are stuck, this is where you can grow
- The problem may be out of your reach.
- If there is a mistake, try again from scratch and check each step carefully.
- Throw away unfounded assumptions
- Start from scratch. Try to understand the problem better.
- Keep track of key variables and symbolically simplify
  - When doing calculations/ looking for right connection,

* Advice
- You need to do alot of problems - feng
- You should read different references

* Study Method
- Initial quick sowing the seeds
  - what is the big idea?
  - ask questions, answer them
  - guess what comes next
- Theorems: look over them
  - what they do
  - what do they require?
  - see key steps, dont get lost in calculation
- Problem: read and try to solve
  - look over the theorems, see how it can apply
  - make your own problems
- Summarize & Review
  - Go over what you should know.
  - State the essential? 1 sentence?
  - Can you write it shorter?
  - Extract modular, commonly used ideas.
- Work for a better understanding - Liu
  - Not complete or perfect
  - Balance and repeat the processes.
