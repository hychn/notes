- old theorem. can you rediscover path to conclusion?
- what are my strengths?
  - asking questions, 
  

* Mentality
- Your joy comes from Christ. Nothing else on earth can provide it.
- If it is true, there must be a solution
- Once you have an heuristic that works, it is relaxing, like sewing - Russian Undergrad
- Revisit and improve your solutions, understanding, and methods.
- Hyper, deep, relaxed focus
- Accept the frustration and difficulty. You are challenged. This is required for improvement.
- Work for consistency
- Spend more time doing

* Heuristic
- Write and understand the problem. What are you given?
- What the question is asking? What is going on?

- Consider equivalent forms of conclusions and hypothesis
- Consider other implications to conclusion
- Look over all the tools ( Everything in book, questions, earlier problems)

- Simple low depth first
- Work with conclusion & hypothesis
- Go to definitions
- Examples that work and don't work. What works? What doesn't work?
  - Essential examples?
- Draw a picture
- Sketch out your idea, see where the problems could be.
- Solve an easier, simpler problem
- Contrapositive? Contradiction?
- Is there something that when given, makes the problem easier?

- Know why an approach will not work well
- Narrow the search space w/ a strong observation
  - Where could the problem be? It must be here, o.w. everything is trivial
  
- Be aware of all the parameters of the problem.
- A feeling/reasons that you are going in a right direction. Otherwise you will get lost and lose alot of time.
- What do you need to find? Can you define, guess it?

- Be very careful at each step. Dont rule out something true.
** Hard problems
- Dig deep into the objects you are working with

* Stuck/Messy/Lost
- When you are stuck, this is where you can grow
- If an idea you have is not working: Can you prove that it doesn't work? A counter example?
- If there is a mistake, try again from scratch and check each step carefully.
- Start from scratch. Try to understand the problem better.
- Keep track of key variables and symbolically simplify
  - When doing calculations/ looking for right connection,
- Throw away unfounded assumptions
- The problem may be out of your reach.

* Advice
- You need to do alot of problems - feng
- You should read different references

* Study Method
- Goal: Understand intuitively and be able to do problems
- Initial brief sowing the seeds
  - What they do, what do they require?
  - Big idea, what is it?
  - Ask questions, answer them
  - Guess what comes next
  - Look for a summary/video/lecture/other reference
- Theorems: look over them
  - 20 min reading sessions, WRITE/UNDERLINE to focus
  - INTUITION, MOTIVATION, why is each step taken?
  - Drop a condition, Converse?
  - Independent cases? Simplest cases?
  - Find simple, essential examples
  - Ask questions, answer them
  - See Key steps, dont get lost in calculation
- Problem: read and try to solve
  - look over the theorems, see how it can apply
  - make your own problems
- Summarize & Review
  - Go over what you should know.
  - State the essential? 1 sentence?
  - Can you write it shorter?
  - Extract modular, commonly used ideas.
  - Reconstruct from an outline.
  - Use examples to help remember.
  - Make the understanding trivial?
- Work for a better understanding - Liu
  - Not complete or perfect
  - Balance and repeat the processes.
  - Come back to it later and improve/answer
