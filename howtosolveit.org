+ solving problem is practical skill
  + like swimming
  + acquire by imitation and practice
  + plenty of opportunity
  
* Understand problem
+ What is the unknown?
+ What are the data?
+ What is the condition?
+ Is it possible to satisfy the condition?
+ Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?
+ Is it insufficient, redudant, contradictory?
+ Is it a reasonable problem?
+ Draw a figure
+ Introduce a suitable notation
+ Separate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them down?

** Getting Acquainted

* Devising a plan
+ Find the connection between the data and the unknown
+ Obliged to consider auxilary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found
+ You should obtain eventually a plan of the solution
+ Have you seen it before?
+ Have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?
+ Do you know a related problem?
+ Do you know a theorem that could be useful?
+ Look at the unknown 
  + Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown
+ Here is a problem related to yours and solved before.
  + Could you use it?
  + Could you use its result?
  + Could you use its method?
  + Should you introduce some auxilary element in order to make its use possible?
    + aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  + Could you restate the problem?
  + Could you restate it still differently?
  + Go back to defintions
  
  
+ If you cannot solve the proposed problem, solve some related problem
+ Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?
+ A more general problem?
+ A more special problem?
+ An analogous problem?
+ Could you solve a part of the problem?
+ Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part; 
  + How far is the unknown then determined, how could it vary?
+ Could you derive something useful from the data?
+ Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?
+ Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if neccesary 
  + So that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
+ Use all the data?
  + Did you use the whole condition?
  + Have you taken into account all essential notion involved int he problem?

* Carrying out the plan
+ Carrying out your plan of the solution.
+ Check each step.
+ Can you see clearly that the step is correct?
+ Can you prove that it is correct?

* Looking back
+ Can you check the result?
+ Can you check the argument?
+ Can you derive the result differently?
+ Can you see it at a glance?
+ Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problems?

* ESC
+ what is unknown
+ what are the data
+ introduce suitable notation
+ is it a reasonable problem
+ is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?
+ see how various items connect
+ see the main connection
+ carry out our plan
+ check each step
+ look back, review discuss
+ re-examine reconsider
