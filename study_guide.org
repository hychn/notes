        - Find pattern among V and reorder, recreate v
        - see if edges can/cannot connect to another V

            - And maybe find more subpaths
        - Find new V to branch out and test
        - See if edges are related
        - Find V that have alot of connections

Asking questions. Saving these questions for later

Maybe I need to arrive at good conclusions.

Have a problem solving session → What are you trying to get out of it?
