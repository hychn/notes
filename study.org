* Mentality
+ The course is a course. Focus on the broad principles that can be applied to all the courses.
+ It is painful and slow, but you must have faith!
+ If stuck... sometimes work backwards, glance at the solution for an idea, or a hint.
+ Create an environment or situation that will make you work
  + disorganized notes will make structure the notes

* Note Taking
+ First write everything. See if a pattern emerges, and group accordingly.

* Time management
+ I am sleeping naps after dinner. I really shouldn't do that.

* Reading
+ During each reading session, try to take away a main, simple idea from each topic
  + So you can get something meaningful out of reading
+ Looking for similar points when you revisit to study later
+ Polya: 1 See that the step is correct. 2 See the purpose of the step.
  + See how humanely possible it is to find such an argument
  + Use the same questions to understand the author's reasoning and feel that he could have discovered it himself by asking the same questions.

* Problem Solving
** Deriving Taylor series
+ Is there a reasonable way to naturally guide myself to the solution?
+ Work with a simpler, subset of the original condition
  + Mindful what variables you can modify to create a simpler problem.
  + a=0, n=1, n=0
  + Can we simplify the problem further?
+ How can you extend the simpler case to the general case?
+ What is it that we are trying to do? What is the goal?
  + Can you explicitly state an relationship, condition, or equation of the goal?
+ Compare your work with existing methods
  + MVT
+ Inspect the interesting properties and requirements and ask how can you use them to solve? or how can you satistfy them?
  + Rolle's requirement f(a)=0, f(b)=0
  + Reduction due to derivative
+ Use these general questions, (work with simpler problem, n=1, n=0, a=0) to as starting points for your work.
+ Have you really understood the problem?
  + I dont think I was completely mindful of the variables a, b
