+ eat, drink whatever you do, do it for the glory of god
+ test every spirit, Jesus Christ is Lord
+ offer your life as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to the Lord
+ have no idol before God
+ give me wisdom to study. ask God for what to do. inquire of God

+ learning takes time
  + spread out your learning over wide period of time
  + do a little bit of learning. digest and repeat again.
  + do more in small bites of time
    + dont drag things out
    + give 1hr to study a topic or chapter. try to get as much as you can out.

+ be comfortable for writing the things out and searching for a solution
  + write things that must be true first.
  + these are the scaffolds you can build, extend on
  + so you do not get lost
  
+ Occam's razor when problem solving
  + so you won't be biased towards complicated approaches
  + if the complicated approaches are standard, try to simplyify the complicated approaches into simple terms

+ dont be mad because you dont know or cant figure it out. try all you can do and ask God for help.
  + be humble

+ can you replace your video watching with reading other books

+ need to do more with a limited amount of time
+ need to be more explosive, decisive


+ review when tired of reading something new
+ make your breaks bring value
+ when you're distracted go for a walk or exercise
  + much better than looking at your phone

+ Improving reading
  + Gain a high level summary of the section
  + Naturally see where the material is going
  + You must work through the book
    + You must treat the theorem as a problem you are trying to prove
  + (Increase Frequency) You must try to revisit the same material many times
  + why when i write the math002 material once, it is much easier?
    + you must go through the material. otherwise you wont remember
    
+ book proof/definitions may be written in concise formal way
  + when you solve problem you work from conclusion and rewrite from start to end
  + maybe book proof is in same way. approach the theorem/ideas like a problem to solve
  + start from conclusion. what we want to achieve. these are the motivations. try to see what we need to achieve the conclusion

+ When stuck, recognize it.
  + Prove that you are stuck.
    + counter example/proof
  + Go back to the foundation.
    + Given and desired conclusion.
    + Have no assumptions!
    + Stubborn when stuck is not good

  + Searching at a broader level
    + Example
    + What do you need? A cover over E using Q
    + Why do we need a cover over E using Q? What properties of Q are we using?
    + for each e in E can we find a ball centered around q?
      + can we adjust it?
      + is it okay if we adjust it? What are we trying to do?
      + build a collection of countable cover of E? Why? To use sequences
        + $e_n$ converges to e in E which means after some n, all of e_n is contained in one of our countable balls


+ why didnt i see that step?
  + recognize when you're stuck
  + what are you doing? is there a more general way of what you are doing?
  + SEE the alternate paths of what you need to do
  + be patient! there is a solution!
  
+ exercise a problem solving mindset for all problems
+ do not rush through!

+ counter example, prove false
+ contrapositive
+ contradiction



+ observe the problem before tackling it
  + see if there's some basic things you can do
  
+ Just because I know it's true doesn't mean I should use it. I should think about it in the best way possible to the situation

+ speak only the truth
+ Be careful what you accept as the general truth


+ need to be more focused. you dont have to be fast just be more focused and each time spent more meaningful


+ practice logical thought throughout your daily life
+ offer your life as living sacrifice to the Lord
  + holy and pleasing to God

+ I feel swamped and panic
  + be calm. trust in the Lord.
  + have faith. dont be afraid.
  + peace be with you
  
+ have to like to read
  + get the big picture before reading
  
  
+ I need to be more structured when I am writing, speaking, and thinking.
+ I need to get into the habit of doing this, while switching back and forth between my mind wandering

+ as you learn something new, try to become well versed in the subject
  + extracting useful and commonly used qualities
  + understanding connection between different concepts
  + practicing it until you get better
  + even redoing old problems
 
 
+ think of learning as having a nicely organized collection of programs
  + rebuiling and refactored
  + seeing common patterns and extracting

+ finding counter examples to see the direction you are thinking is true

+ try to search for the simplest solutions first
  + before doing something more complicated
  
+ see what kind of works
  + how can you alter it to get the solution?
  
+ can you see the big picture from skim reading?
