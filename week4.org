+ offer your life as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to the Lord
+ have no idol before God
+ give me wisdom to study. ask God for what to do. inquire of God

+ when you have an idea sketch of the proof be prepared to go through several revisions 
  + work in a way that facilitate this
  
+ praise your effort, not your intelligence
  + you work harder to be engaged in effort
  + instead of trying to be validated in your intelligence
  
+ how we feel about prev. day performance and future performance can increase our energy levels
  
+ 30 min 3 hr 11hr after waking up


+ reinforce good behavior that aligns with your goals

  + slog through the discomfort, doubts
  

+ be very careful at distractions. 
  + such as using your phone
  + it weakens your mind
  
  
  

+ lessons from exam
  + be mindful of time
  + when you write solution be absolutely sure it is true
  + read the question carefully 
  
+ look for independent properties
  + be mindful of related/ unrelated properties

+ test yourself
  + be willing to test yourself put yourself through the fire
  + ask questions try to answer them
  + work on problems try to answer them. earnestly and honestly
  + as if you were in exam room
+ learning takes time
  + spread out your learning over wide period of time
  + do a little bit of learning. digest and repeat again.
  + do more in small bites of time. 1hr, 30min
    + dont drag things out
    + give 1hr to study a topic or chapter. try to get as much as you can out.
    + makes each bit of time meaningful
    + danger of looking for something that isn't there
      + rabbit hole too deep going nowhere
      + write it down, come back to it later
      
  + orient yourself to develop an intuition
  + recall/learning exercises
    + teach yourself feyman scratch
    + dont give up easily. 10 min timer additional time
    + practice often over period of time

+ be comfortable for writing the things out and searching for a solution
  + write things that must be true first.
  + these are the scaffolds you can build, extend on
  + so you do not get lost
  
+ Occam's razor when problem solving
  + so you won't be biased towards complicated approaches
  + if the complicated approaches are standard, try to simplyify the complicated approaches into simple terms

+ dont be mad because you dont know or cant figure it out. try all you can do and ask God for help.
  + be humble

+ can you replace your video watching with reading other books

+ need to do more with a limited amount of time
+ need to be more explosive, decisive
+ treat reading book like a lecture, given by the author. 1hr


+ review when tired of reading something new
+ make your breaks bring value
+ when you're distracted go for a walk or exercise
  + much better than looking at your phone

+ Improving reading
  + Gain a high level summary of the section
  + Naturally see where the material is going
  + You must work through the book
    + You must treat the theorem as a problem you are trying to prove
  + (Increase Frequency) You must try to revisit the same material many times
  + why when i write the math002 material once, it is much easier?
    + you must go through the material. otherwise you wont remember
    
+ book proof/definitions may be written in concise formal way
  + when you solve problem you work from conclusion and rewrite from start to end
  + maybe book proof is in same way. approach the theorem/ideas like a problem to solve
  + start from conclusion. what we want to achieve. these are the motivations. try to see what we need to achieve the conclusion

+ When stuck, recognize it.
  + Prove that you are stuck.
    + counter example/proof
  + Go back to the foundation.
    + Given and desired conclusion.
    + Have no assumptions!
    + Stubborn when stuck is not good

  + Searching at a broader level
    + Example
    + What do you need? A cover over E using Q
    + Why do we need a cover over E using Q? What properties of Q are we using?
    + for each e in E can we find a ball centered around q?
      + can we adjust it?
      + is it okay if we adjust it? What are we trying to do?
      + build a collection of countable cover of E? Why? To use sequences
        + $e_n$ converges to e in E which means after some n, all of e_n is contained in one of our countable balls


+ why didnt i see that step?
  + recognize when you're stuck
  + what are you doing? is there a more general way of what you are doing?
  + SEE the alternate paths of what you need to do
  + be patient! there is a solution!
  
+ exercise a problem solving mindset for all problems
+ do not rush through!

+ counter example, prove false
+ contrapositive
+ contradiction



+ observe the problem before tackling it
  + see if there's some basic things you can do
  
+ Just because I know it's true doesn't mean I should use it. I should think about it in the best way possible to the situation

+ speak only the truth
+ Be careful what you accept as the general truth


+ need to be more focused. you dont have to be fast just be more focused and each time spent more meaningful


+ practice logical thought throughout your daily life
+ offer your life as living sacrifice to the Lord
  + holy and pleasing to God

+ I feel swamped and panic
  + be calm. trust in the Lord.
  + have faith. dont be afraid.
  + peace be with you
  
+ have to like to read
  + get the big picture before reading
  
  
+ I need to be more structured when I am writing, speaking, and thinking.
+ I need to get into the habit of doing this, while switching back and forth between my mind wandering

+ as you learn something new, try to become well versed in the subject
  + extracting useful and commonly used qualities
  + understanding connection between different concepts
  + practicing it until you get better
  + even redoing old problems
 
 
+ think of learning as having a nicely organized collection of programs
  + rebuiling and refactored
  + seeing common patterns and extracting

+ finding counter examples to see the direction you are thinking is true

+ try to search for the simplest solutions first
  + before doing something more complicated
  
+ see what kind of works
  + how can you alter it to get the solution?
  
+ can you see the big picture from skim reading?

+ be mindful of the parameters of a definition
  + create different examples by adjusting parameters
  + ex. an open cover. $/union B_r(c)$ we can adjust r, c.
    + with c=0, and r ranging over all, you can bound elements 
    + with r smaller than distance btw center and a point, you can exclude a point from a cove ar
 
 + go over each word, what it means, what it can do. Do not hastly skip over something you do not understand. listen to your inner voice
   + ex. why the word closed
   
   
+ look at the questions in the book. see why those questions are important
  + see how you can discover similar questions
  + ex: E < K compact. Is E compact?
