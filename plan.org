- BP1 (i) is irreducible because two functions a(x)b(x) = t^p-x^p with a = (t^n + ... + x^i), b =  (t^m + ... + x^j) 
needs more detail idea is to show that if x^   i in base field, x is in base field.
- BP1 (iii) since it any element of Gal(K\F) fix the base field, it must map roots of
t^p-x^p = (t-x)^p to roots and t^p-y^p = (t-y)^p to roots. And this will completely determine the map since x, y are generators of K.
So x can only go to x and y can only go to y.
