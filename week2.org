+ do not rush
+ do not do random search
+ recognize when you're stuck or lost

+ difficult problems provide an opportunity for growth
** what things did I do well?
+ try to understand the simpler problem well
  + revisited the simpler problem to understand it better
  + in this specific case the statement is true
  + can we use this to get what we need

+ we stopped ourselves randomly searching
  + identified when we were lost
  + we were proceeding without a good direction
  
+ I made a grid, enumerating the possible cases
+ look for frequently appearing things and show that they follow a certain behavior
  + it has powerful consequences
  
+ don't be afraid of searching for a solution in different ways
+ managing your time and being wise about how you spend your timetime
+ prove a smaller helper theorem
+ use finite or simpler situations to test an idea
+ check if a proposed theorem is reasonable or not
  + counterexamples, or an example that works

** how to generalize
+ extract common, significant variables.
+ model system of relationship between the variable
+ see common themes values
+ time, energy, persistence
