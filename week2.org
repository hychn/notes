** in class notes
probability 
+ insight is the ability to see complicated things from
+ see the truth
+ don't freeze. set yourself loose on the problem
+ secrets to doing good math
  + get enough sleep
  + remove distractions so that you get bored to do math
+ study a lot of examples and combine them
+ come up with examples
+ can you write things in a way so that your brain can interchange symbols
+ can the letters change around on the paper?

analysis
+ you need to preread and prepare
+ the significance of characterizations
+ understand contrapositive
+ under which condition is there a characterization

num analysis 
+ summarize after each chapter & section
+ get a global picture
+ see if you can shorten a summary
+ when counting find things to enumerate with
  + do not do it in your head

** week notes
+ see the same fact from many sides
  + see the variables in the statements and how those variables can change
+ see the reverse negation of the statement
+ treat it like movement, navigation of your thoughts
+ treat it like exploration, carefully strategically mapping and traveling

+ when stuck for a long time see if you can identify a shorter path to the solution
+ be careful when you write and speak at all times, even in your daily life apply to principles that you have learned, practice them at all times
+ each step that you take should be logical and must have reason because the step costs time

+ see how you can effectively rest and refresh yourself

+ come up with good questions and solutions for those questions
+ draw an accurate diagram that represents the order of the natural world
+ make it a habit this is who a mathematician is

+ don't lose sight of the forest because of the trees
  + don't get lost in bunch of small details see the big picture theorems
+ recognize that different paths lead to different solutions.
  + and they're very real and they exist
  + you can manage how to take good paths over others
  + you must study how to take effective pets assess paths
  + there are bad paths of thought
  
+ summarize what you did write the key points down
+ be careful of each every step it must be correct and precise

+ solve the problem again to make sure that you aren't lucky
  + be consistent in your ability to find a solution
  
+ don't feel burden that you have to learn many things
  + as a graduate student you must do this
  + learn the things that scale very well

+ you need to practice reading comprehension
  + things that you look at twice three times four times are much easier to understand
  + if you're reading comprehension improves then you can revisit the same material many times
  
+ some books are like dictionaries such as hungerford


** battle notes 3hr what things did I do well?
+ try to understand the simpler problem well
  + revisited the simpler problem to understand it better
  + in this specific case the statement is true
  + can we use this to get what we need

+ we stopped ourselves randomly searching
  + identified when we were lost
  + we were proceeding without a good direction
  
+ I made a grid, enumerating the possible cases
+ look for frequently appearing things and show that they follow a certain behavior
  + it has powerful consequences
  
+ don't be afraid of searching for a solution in different ways
+ managing your time and being wise about how you spend your timetime
+ prove a smaller helper theorem
+ use finite or simpler situations to test an idea
+ check if a proposed theorem is reasonable or not
  + counterexamples, or an example that works

** how to generalize
+ how can I distill what works well
+ how can I verify if something works well or not
+ how can I gain the skill more quickly

+ extract common, significant variables.
+ model system of relationship between the variable
+ see common themes values
+ time, energy, persistence
