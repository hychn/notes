- specific<general
- Bernoulli<Binom
* Arthmetic properties of distributions
- sum of normal, bernoulli, poision, exp, geometric
- X~N(0,1) X^2~Chisq

# STATISTICS
* Exponential Family
* Defs
  - Random Sample
  - Likelihood 
  - Statistic
  - MLE
  - Sample Mean, Sample Variance
  - Unbiased Estimator
  - Sufficient
  - Consistent 
  - Strongly Consistent
  - Efficiency
  - Complete Statistic
  
* Uniqueness of MLE
* 1-1 Function of Suff stat is sufficient
* cont function of consistent stat is consistent
* Cramer Rao Lower Bound
* Factorization Characterization for Sufficent Statistic
* Exponential Family Sufficent and Complete Statistic
* MVUE THM

* Def: Bias, MSE

* Bayesian Statistics
