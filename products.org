* Category
** Def
+ objects
+ morphisms for pair of objects
+ composition of morphisms: associative, identity

** Questions
+ ?can you form identity morphism?
+ ?is it similar to concept of being of same cardinality?
+ ?Why is commutativity so important?

** Example
+ commutes
  + Is commutative a critical property?



* Product
** Def
+ Product (object) for family of objects $\{A_i | i \in S\}$
+ with family of morphisms $\{\pi_i | i \in S \}$ with $\pi_i: P \rightarrow A_i$
+ such that for any object B with family of morphism $\{f_i | i \in S\}$ with $f_i: B \rightarrow A_i$
  + exists unique morphism $\psi: B \rightarrow P$
  + commute $\pi_i \circ \psi = f_i$
