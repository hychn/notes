* Don't trust money, your strength, your ability, or your intellect
+ I had issues with the bank
+ I am humbled by my lack of strength
+ I didn't pass the qual. I am not sure of my ability
+ But I trust in God. I have faith in him to show me the way.
* I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you. (Psalm 32:8)
* Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die... (Ruth 1:16)
+ But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.” When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
