If you can't solve a problem then there's an easier problem you can solve; find it").

Get attached. If you aren’t motivated to solve a problem, chances are you’re not truly invested in the process.
Instead of solving for X or Y, Terence recommends thinking of the endeavor as a search for clues or a battle against a wily enemy. Because solving a problem can be labor-intensive and often involves failing again and again, finding (or ascribing) some semblance of meaning in the process is crucial

There is a certain way in which mathematicians approach problems,” says Terence Tao. “We abstract them. We break them up into pieces. We make analogies. We try to find connections with other problems

You want problems that are just barely outside the range of all your tools.

Terence will often use mathematical tools of abstraction to simplify things. This could involve taking key components of a problem and representing them with mathematical “objects” like numbers or shapes. In order to do this in a way that makes sense, you first need to figure out which elements of the problem are most important. “We’re really stripping the problem down to its bare essentials,” Terence says. “By moving the inessential components of a problem, you can focus on what’s really going on.”


Analogies can help you understand the mechanics of a problem or even its philosophical underpinning.
