+ explore the different possibilities when encountering a simple statement with a variable
+ plug in different values for the variable

+ reading, working through the material
  + ask questions see how you can arrive
  + be thankful for an incomplete understanding
  + come back and try again
  + when note taking write the main ideas and key questions
    + so that you can re-explore this topic much quicker next time
    + and log other key paths and questions


+ what does it mean to learn the essence of an idea
+ how can I do this more effectively when I'm learning new topics

+ command your time, masterfully live your day, do it for the glory of your Lord

+ when exploring certain ideas
  + can you generalize specific series of statements
  
+ can you use audio, alternative forms to help you study
  + teaching, talking, listening, writing, drawing
  
  
+ mathematics is an accumulation.
  + strong, broad foundation
  + I have faith God will deliver
    + though my efforts are not enough

+ logically chose paths that make sense, if the conclusion is true.
  + ex. pick the smallest element required for our problem. if the inequality is true, the smallest element should be sufficient.

+ triangle inequality. a natural inequality that is true in general. gives rise to useful properties
+ A=bt you can get an inequality by solving for b
  + however if you can find a inf. minimal form of A, over all possible values of A defined in our problem, you get the best possible inequality. something that must hold true in all cases.


+ as you solve problems following a plan, ask yourself and inspect what is going on?
  + see if you can generalize what is going on, or find the useful property

+ when you cannot come to a conclusion it does not necessarily mean that the approach is wrong

+ just as you think before you speak, think before you do anything, think before you write


  + when there's a problem take care of it right away

+ proof writing is an important skill
  + being concise and precise
  + otherwise how would you know if anything is true at all

+ understanding the intuition is important

+ find the balance
  + need to practice in office setting
  + need to rest and think comfortably

+ two different mindset when looking for the big idea vs proving a specific nitty detail

+ when solving problems try to do it a limited amount of time

+ be very critical in writing your own proof
  + if something is confusing, think of counter examples to each statement you have made

+ what is the problem? what is difficult? what is the hard part to manage
